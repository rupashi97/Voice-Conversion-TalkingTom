# Talking Tom

Talking Tom is an existing virtual pet app in which a virtual animal squeakily repeats anything
that the user says into the device's microphone. The app records the voice of the user through
microphone, in digital format, which is then modulated to a certain pitch/tempo
and played through the microphone, creating a Chipmunk-like effect.

In this project,various possible techniques for voice conversion have been explored that could mimic what the app does and four such techniques have been implemented: Resampling , Phase Vocoder , Delay based Pitch Shifting, Pitch-Synchronous Overlap and Add (PSOLA).

Requirements : MATLAB, Octave
